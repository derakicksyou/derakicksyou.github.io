eMap is a middle party company for mapping. Their brand became very outdated over the years because they are focused on the business to business world. I was brought in to update there current identity for the current times, and in the process I tried to bring a timelessness to it as well.

After the eMap refresh I was also commissioned to do an identity package with icons for one of their new products to hit the market called Vector Lock. Which would help secure their mapping data under the time limited licenses they provide.
