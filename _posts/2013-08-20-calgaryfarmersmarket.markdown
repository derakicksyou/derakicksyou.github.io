Calgary Farmers Market approached us with interest in refreshing there visual brand online. They were currently in the process of having a new building constructed to house their revamped market with intentions of the new site to launch in tandem.

The concepts of the site were inspired heavily from sketches of the new market: young, accessible, and fresh was the direction that was set for the site. Teaming up with [Anthony Dimitre](http://anthonydimitre.com/) to have another set of eyes & ideas.
