While consulting for [Mondo Robot](http://mondorobot.com/) and their various clients, I seemed to pick up a lot of the Microsoft Live@Edu work they had. Most of it was basic collateral for various projects for blogging networks and student social spaces, and occasionally some artwork for the Zune which was exciting!
