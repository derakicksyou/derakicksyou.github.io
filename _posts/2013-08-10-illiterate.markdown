This Print/Web Magazine now Gallery was in need of a new identity for its brand as well as a website design to continue itâ€™s effort that engages users to submit artistic work to an online community. Later this content will be published quarterly to the printed magazine, highlighting some of the best work. A custom typeface was designed for the identity.
