This projected started with [Corey Donohoe](http://twitter.com/#!/atmos) & his interest to use twitter to invite some friends for a beer with the details of who was actually going. I became friends with Corey midway through his development of the app, and he was really excited by my work, and asked myself and [Tyler Montgomery](http://twitter.com/#!/ubermajestix) to help with UI, UX, and branding. Working on this project didnâ€™t only build a fun little project but a great friendship. The project has now become open source for others to take on!
