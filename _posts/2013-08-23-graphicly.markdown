Graphicly came to me originally to help them update their current &#038; new offerings for the iPhone &#038; Nook. Which was an awesome experience to play with some amazing assets from tons of comic books!

Later they came and were interested in making a more in-depth graphic series app for purchasing and subscribing for the iPad. Each would be an app for a graphic novel collection, with links to embrace conversation online, and extras! So the idea came up with trying to simulate the experience of you reading your comic book on your desk like you were a kid again. With natural movements, of swiping the book away to checkout the navigation and supporting pages.
