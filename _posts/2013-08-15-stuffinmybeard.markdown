This has been a project of love, since 2007. Started for the shear fact of how awesome beards are! A former co-worker of mine, had an amazing beard where he would stash items in it for later use. The basic idea, was a blog for posting various things found about beards, but the audience quickly grew into the 10s of thousands. This has called for various other aspects of “beard-age”, such as shirts, iGoogle homepage, and some fun guerrilla art.

In late 2009 the site was hacked, and with the current workload I had at the time sat for a number of months. It was a good thing though, for the fact it let me re look at the brand and the objective, and take a little re-approach.
