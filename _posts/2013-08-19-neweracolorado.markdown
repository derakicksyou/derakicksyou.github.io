New Era Colorado, is a nonprofit non-partisan voting initiative based in Boulder, Colorado that runs tons of campaigns each year to drive movements and awareness on certain topics. With all these campaigns there of course is the need for design and direction.

The project above was a microsite pushing people to register to vote or check to see if their information is current. Making the site optimized to run on mobile platforms was ideal for them so their volunteers at events can take down information on the fly!
