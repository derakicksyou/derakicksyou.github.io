Blipsnips was a client that came to us (Dojo4) for creating their product from the ground up! They brought to the table an existing identity that allowed us to set a nice little package for them to launch with. The basic idea of the product was a timeline based bookmarking or making a table of contents of a video.

Working through many wireframes and user experiences we were able to create the product itself. Since the launch of Blipsnips they came back to us a couple times to add new product offerings like the facebook app, and iPhone app which allowed us to continue and further their brand.
