I’m your standard east coaster that says things funny like: wooder (water), hoagie (sub), punkin (pumpkin), and yous (you
all). I am rarely ever clean shaven. I might look like a hooligan but, I am a nice person.

If you want to get to the business stuff here is my <a href="http://jeffreylarrimore.com/resume/"

My work from a machinist to upholstery trimmer have taught me a lot in my art career. Clean, simple, & well-built items
that suit the consumers needs. That has always seemed like the approach to me. In life and in work we learn. I’ve made
mistakes and torn things apart ever since I got my first bike… Interesting how we don’t change much from when we were
five years old.
