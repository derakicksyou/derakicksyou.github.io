Jeffrey Larrimore â€” Design & Direction
======================================

I am a San Francisco based designer from the City of Brotherly Love. I have a core foundation in design and dabble in some code from time to time.

If you want to get to the business stuff here is my [Resume](http://jeffreylarrimore.com/resume/) & [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreylarrimore).

__I was fed up with Wordpress and decided to try Jekyll. I was able to port this site over in a day! SUPER easy with the help of Jekyll to power my posts!__
